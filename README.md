Welcome to my personal website! Everything in the repository was built with HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and JQuery
without using any external website generators. Is it inefficient? Could I have just not used Wix? Sure! But I wanted to
learn front-end design so I purposefully challenged myself to self-design this website.

Anyways here's a picture of a young coding Mike to test README's images.
